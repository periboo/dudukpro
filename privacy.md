# DudukPro Privacy Policy

Your sound stays on your phone.

DudukPro is designed as an offline practice tool. All audio processing, analysis and recordings happen directly on your device.

## What DudukPro does

- Uses the **microphone** only while tuner, analysis or recording functions are active.  
- Stores your **recordings, duduk profiles and reed notes** locally on your device.  
- Uses **Bluetooth audio** if you choose headphones or speakers in your system settings. Using Bluetooth headphones or speakers is **strongly recommended**, as it allows the tuner (microphone input) and audio playback (drone, metronome, recordings) to work together cleanly without the phone’s speaker and mic interfering with each other.

## What DudukPro does not do

- No account, login or cloud sync.  
- No automatic upload of recordings or practice data.  
- No sharing of your audio, usage data or personal information with third parties.  
- No ads or external trackers.

You stay in control. You can delete recordings and other locally stored data at any time from within the app or your device’s storage settings.
